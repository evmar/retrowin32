# retrowin32 for web

retrowin32 can build the emulator as a WebAssembly bundle. There is a central
`Host` abstraction (see [win32 docs](../win32/README.md)) that collects
functions exposed by the hosting environment, and on web these mostly forward
out to TypeScript implementations.

(Why TypeScript? The edit-compile cycle and debugging experience of using
TypeScript is currently a lot better than Rust.)

There are two web frontends that share the emulator integration logic:

1. `run.html`/`run.tsx` is the smaller "run a program" UI
2. `debugger.html`/`debugger.tsx` implements the x86 debugger

## Code layout

- `glue/` -- the Rust library that becomes wasm

## The retrowin32 website

The retrowin32 website is a mixture of files generated by the [appdb](../appdb)
tools and some hand-written files which also live in this directory.

The deployed website lives in the `pages` Git branch. The [deploy.sh](deploy.sh)
script runs the build process for generated files, which includes the wasm
bundle, the TypeScript, and the appdb. It has some comments about how it expects
to be set up to run.
