# retrowin32 on x86-64

This collects notes on running retrowin32 "natively" on x86-64 Rosetta on Macs.

See blog post summarizing this work:
https://neugierig.org/software/blog/2023/08/x86-x64-aarch64.html

To build, run

```
$ ./build-rosetta.sh
```

For a release version with debug symbols:

```
$ RUSTFLAGS=-g ./build-rosetta.sh --release
```

## Wine background

The main post to get things started was
[this big description of the hack](https://www.winehq.org/pipermail/wine-devel/2019-December/156602.html).

## Executable layout

Print pagezero info:

```
$ otool -l the/binary
```

Dump sections in a .rlib:

```
$ size -mlx path/to/rlib
```

## LDT

We use two LDT entries:

1. To jump between 32 and 64 bit code. A Darwin file that has some notes on
   using LDT to trampoline between 32 and 64-bit.

   https://github.com/apple/darwin-xnu/blob/main/tests/ldt.c#L73

2. The FS register used for thread local storage.

## Calling between x86-64 and x86

To switch the processor between x86-64 and x86 ("compatibility") mode, you
switch the CS register. There are assembly primitives "far call"/"far jmp"/"far
ret" that manage these.

- A far jmp takes an address of a "m16:32" destination:
  `segment_selector << 32 | destination_ip`.
- A far call pushes the current m16:32 and jmps.
- A far ret pops a m16:32 and jmps.

Assembly handling of these particular instructions is a bit finicky. Some tools
disassemble them as plain jmp/call/ret, and expressing the instructions is
undocumented. Using AT&T assembly syntax helped.

### WOW64 and heaven's gate

WOW64, the native Windows support for x86 in an x86-64 process, must do the same
transition. It's documented in various blog posts that refer to it as "heaven's
gate".

Here snippets of the relevant assembly follow for a 32->64-bit call, with some
annotations as to which specific call/jmp form they use. It seems this varies a
lot between Windows versions etc. and it's muddled further lots of irrelevant
details, but it's

The 32-bit function starts out:

```
part1:
mov eax, ...   # possibly an id of the desired 64-bit fn to call?
mov edx, part2
call edx   # ff d2 => ff /2 edx, near call edx
```

```
part2:
jmp [part3]  # ff 25 ...  => ff /4 disp32, near jmp disp32
```

part3 is called `Wow64Transition`` in some places. It does the actual 32->64
transition, and is code shared by all 32->64 calls.

```
part3:
jmp 0033:addr   # ea ...  =>  jmpf ptr16:32, far jmp to absolute addr
...
more x86-64 code here  # <- addr points here
presumably this forwards to the actual desired call
```

Takeaways:

1. they hard-coded the segment selector, maybe? unless they're doing some
   modification when the dll loads, but all references I see have it using 0x33.
2. they use an absolute jmp to jmp forwards by just an instruction when
   transitioning 32->64

### 64 -> 32

To start the executable, or to call a 32-bit callback from a winapi definition,
we must transition from 64-bit to 32-bit.

We start in 64-bit mode in Rust code. We don't want to touch any of the
processor state here since it is fully controlled by Rust.

We need to end up in 32-bit mode in the exe with the stack laid out as follows,
as described by stdcall:

```
return address (as pushed by call)
argument 0
argument 1
...
argument N
```

and it will clear all that from the stack when it returns with an ordinary
`ret`.

The `ljmp`/`lcall` variants that take an absolute `segment selector:address` are
not available in 64-bit mode, so we must call through the `m16:32` variants that
take a memory location.

### 32 -> 64

32-bit code will call our implementations of the windows API, which are 64-bit.

At the start the stack is a stdcall frame as pictured above. We control the
address that the call maps to, and we control the logic on the other side of
that call, so we have a lot of flexibility in how it's handled.

Opposite from 64->32-bit calls, we control the callee rather than the caller.
This means we can put things on the stack that we choose because we control how
they're interpreted.

The chain of calls is:

1. [32-bit, from executable] user code has some sort of `call TheFn`
2. [32-bit asm] for each `TheFn`, impl does an `lcall tramp64`
3. [64-bit asm] `tramp64` switches to 64-bit stack, then calls Rust code
   `call call64`
4. [64-bit Rust] `call64` looks up the shim by index by examining the return
   address, and calls it via ordinary Rust code
5. [64-bit asm] `tramp64` long returns to 32-bit asm
6. [32-bit asm] cleans up 32-bit stack

### Calling conventions

See https://www.agner.org/optimize/calling_conventions.pdf chapter 6.

The 32-bit code uses the win32 ABI: parameters are passed on the stack and the
callee saves EBX, ESI, EDI, and EBP.

The 64-bit code uses the SysV ABI: parameters go in RDI/RSI/etc. and the callee
saves RBX/RBP.

## Trampoline assembly

We need to generate some snippets of 32-bit assembly. For example, each API call
in the exe is to a different address, and the code at that address needs to
forward on which function was called. We need to embed some runtime values into
the generated assembly.

So I wrote the relevant 32-bit assembly by hand in a .s file, and the script
print-asm.sh prints their source bytes such that they can be embedded by hand in
the Rust code.

Run it like:

```
$ ./win32/src/print-asm.sh
```

### Low addresses

Previously I was worried that our code wasn't loaded at low (32 bit) addresses,
but I changed things so that it would be.

A note from before that fix: we cannot use Rust's `asm!` related macros to
generate asm directly, as it generates code at higher addresses. I tinkered a
bit with trying to convice `global_asm!` to emit a span of labels that I could
then snip out at build time but I couldn't figure it out.

## x86-64 SDL

```
$ tar xf SDL-whatever.tar.gz
$ cd SDL-whatever
$ arch -x86_64 bash
$ ./configure --prefix=`pwd`/x86
$ make -j8 install
```

Then to build with it:

```
$ export LIBRARY_PATH=above/path/x86/lib
```

## linux notes

ld --verbose | grep SEGMENT_START
puts the exe at 0x40_0000
  PROVIDE (__executable_start = SEGMENT_START("text-segment", 0x400000)); . = SEGMENT_START("text-segment", 0x400000) + SIZEOF_HEADERS;
