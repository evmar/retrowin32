//! "Shims" are my word for the mechanism for x86 -> retrowin32 (and back) calls.
//!
//! The win32_derive::dllexport attribute on our shim functions wraps them with
//! a prologue/epilogue that does the required stack manipulation to read
//! arguments off the x86 stack and transform them into Rust types, so the Rust
//! functions can act as if they're just being called from Rust.
//!
//! There are three underlying implementations of Shims:
//! 1. shims_emu.rs, which is used with the in-tree CPU emulator
//! 2. shims_raw.rs, which is used when executing x86 natively
//! 3. shims_unicorn.rs, which is used with the Unicorn CPU emulator
