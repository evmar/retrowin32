//! "Shims" are my word for the mechanism for x86 -> retrowin32 (and back) calls.
//! This module implements shims under the x86 emulator.
//!
//! In the simple case, we register Rust functions like kernel32.dll!ExitProcess
//! to associate with a special invalid x86 address.  If the x86 ever jumps to such an
//! address, we forward the call to the registered shim handler.
//!
//! The complex case is when our Rust function needs to call back into x86
//! code.  x86 emulation executes one basic block of instructions at a time, while
//! our Rust shim functions execute to completion synchronously, so the latter
//! cannot directly call the former.
//!
//! To reconcile these, we make functions that call back into x86 into "async"
//! Rust functions, that return a Future.
//!
//! 1) A given shim winapi function like IDirectDraw7::EnumDisplayModes needs
//!    to call back to x86 with each available display mode.
//! 2) To do so, we change its body to the form:
//!
//!    #[win32_derive::dllexport]
//!    async fn EnumDisplayModes(...) -> u32 {
//!      ...setup code...
//!      // Call into x86 function and await its result.
//!      shims::call_x86(some_ptr, vec![args]).await;
//!      // Return to x86 caller, as before.
//!      0
//!    }
//! 3) The dllexport transform notices that async type and forwards
//!    to push_async in this module, which redirects the x86 to call
//!    async_executor next.
//! 4) async_executor picks up the Future returned in step #2 and runs it.
//!
//! Concretely when EnumDisplayModes is called, the "simple case" shim logic as
//! described above runs as before, but rather than returning to the caller
//! we instead also push a call to async_executor, which adds itself to the call stack
//! and runs the async state machine.  In the case of call_x86 that means the
//! x86 code eventually invoked there will return control back to async_executor.
