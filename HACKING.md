# Hacking on retrowin32

## Building

### Linux
If you are building on Debian/Ubuntu you will need to make sure you have the 
following packages:

```
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev
```

### CLI

Build/run the CLI app:

```
$ make emu opt=1
$ ./target/release/retrowin32 exe/zig_hello/hello.exe
```

The command line as seen by the program is an optional third argument:

```
$ ./target/release/retrowin32 path/to/some.exe "c:\\some.exe arg1 arg2"
```

The `--win32-trace` flag controls tracing of win32 API calls. Passing `*` (which
must be quoted from the shell) makes retrowin32 trace all calls.

To iterate while developing I often use a command like this, which builds and
runs in one invocation.

```
$ cargo run -p retrowin32 -F x86-emu -- --win32-trace '*' path/to/my/exe
```

(You might pass `--release` for faster binaries or `-F x86-emu,sdl` for GUI
support.)

### Rosetta

Rosetta mode (see [doc/x86-64.md](doc/x86-64.md)):

```
$ make rosetta
$ ./target/x86_64-apple-darwin/debug/retrowin32 exe/zig_hello/hello.exe
```

### Web

Build/run the web app:

```
$ make deploy opt=1
$ cd web
$ npm run serve
```

## Compile-time features matrix

The above `make` commands cover the main things you'd build, but they wrap some
more subtle configuration.

To choose the x86 emulation strategy, you must pick a Rust "feature":

- `x86-emu`: retrowin32's own x86 emulator
- `x86-64`: generate x86-64 code, requires x86 CPU or Rosetta
- `x86-unicorn`: use [Unicorn](https://www.unicorn-engine.org/) (effectively
  QEMU) for x86 emulation

To choose the rendering strategy, there is one further toggle:

- `sdl`: use sdl2 for graphics
- otherwise
  - non-web: headless mode, crash on any graphics calls
  - web: render to DOM

Web builds require `x86-emu` and no `sdl`.

## Code layout

- `x86/` -- the x86 emulator
- `win32/` -- the win32 emulator
  - `win32/src/winapi/` -- the Windows API implementation
- `cli/` -- a command-line emulator runner
- `web/` -- a webapp that runs the emulator in a browser
  - `web/glue/` -- wasm glue for the `win32/` API
- `exe/` -- some sample Windows executables
- `memory/` -- a memory abstraction shared by `x86` and `win32`
- `appdb/` -- metadata about particular binaries, see
  [appdb/README.md](appdb/README.md)
