# Hacking on retrowin32

## Setup

### Mac

```
$ brew install sdl2
$ export LIBRARY_PATH="$LIBRARY_PATH:$(brew --prefix)/lib"
```

### Linux

Debian/Ubuntu:

```
$ sudo apt install libsdl2-dev
```

## CLI build

Build/run the CLI app:

```
$ cargo build -p retrowin32 -F x86-emu,sdl --profile=lto
$ ./target/lto/retrowin32 exe/zig_hello/hello.exe
```

The command line as seen by the program is an optional third argument:

```
$ ./target/lto/retrowin32 path/to/some.exe "c:\\some.exe arg1 arg2"
```

The `--win32-trace` flag controls tracing of win32 API calls. Passing `*` (which
must be quoted from the shell) makes retrowin32 trace all win32 calls.

### Rosetta

On Apple Silicon (ARM) Macs there is tentative support for running via the
Rosetta x86 emulator. See [doc/x86-64.md](doc/x86-64.md) for instructions.

## Web

Build/run the web app:

```
$ cd web
$ make
$ npm run serve
```

Optionally, `make profile=lto` for faster binary.

## Compile-time features matrix

The above commands cover the main things you'd build, but they wrap some more
subtle configuration.

To choose the x86 emulation strategy, you must pick a Rust "feature":

- `x86-emu`: retrowin32's own x86 emulator
- `x86-64`: generate x86-64 code, requires x86 CPU or Rosetta
- `x86-unicorn`: use [Unicorn](https://www.unicorn-engine.org/) (effectively
  QEMU) for x86 emulation (note: probably broken at this point)

To choose the rendering strategy, there is one further toggle:

- `sdl`: use sdl2 for graphics
- otherwise
  - non-web: headless mode, crash on any graphics calls
  - web: render to DOM

Web builds require `x86-emu` and no `sdl`.

### rust-analyzer

Rust's IDE support doesn't know about which features you're using. In VSCode I
configure it via my workspace config, like the following, which I change when
working on different sets of features:

```json
"rust-analyzer.cargo.noDefaultFeatures": true,
"rust-analyzer.check.features": [
  "x86-emu",
  "sdl"
],
"rust-analyzer.cargo.features": [
  "x86-emu",
  "sdl"
],
"rust-analyzer.cargo.extraEnv": {
  "XWIN": "/Users/evmar/redist"
}
```

## Building while developing

There are three build profiles:

- `lto`: slowest build, highest performance
- `debug`: fastest build, lowest performance
- `release`: compromise between the above two

To iterate while developing I often use a command like this, which builds and
runs in one invocation.

```
$ cargo run -p retrowin32 -F x86-emu -- --win32-trace '*' path/to/my/exe
```

And sometimes I add:

- `--release` when the debug build runs too slowly, and
- `-F x86-emu,sdl` for GUI support

## Code layout

- `x86/` -- the x86 emulator
- [`win32/`](win32/) -- the win32 emulator, see README
- `cli/` -- a command-line emulator runner
- `web/` -- a webapp that runs the emulator in a browser
  - `web/glue/` -- wasm glue for the `win32/` API
- `exe/` -- some sample Windows executables
- `memory/` -- a memory abstraction shared by `x86` and `win32`
- [`appdb/`](appdb/) -- metadata about particular binaries, see README
- `misc/` -- minor helper tools
