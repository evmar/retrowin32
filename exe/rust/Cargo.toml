# Note: for compatibility with i586-pc-windows-msvc (and not just i686),
# we need windows-sys to pick up a newer windows-targets dep:
# https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs/issues/3006
# This is apparently picked up in the lock file.

# Further, note that versions 0.59+ break rust-analyzer:
# https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs/issues/3440
